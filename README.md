This project is a voice-enabled web application designed to help students — especially those with disabilities — write tests or exams using voice commands. The system supports both voice instructions and spoken answers, then automatically grades the test and submits results to the lecturer.


🚀 Features
🎤 Voice Command Interface: Control the system using speech — from navigating to starting or submitting an exam.

📝 Voice-Based Answer Input: Speak your answers instead of typing them.

🤖 Auto-Grading Engine: The system automatically checks and grades the test or exam once completed.

📤 Automatic Submission: Results are instantly submitted to the lecturer or stored in a results database.

♿ Accessibility First: Especially designed to support students with disabilities in taking assessments independently.


💡 Purpose
This project was built to:

Provide an inclusive platform for learners who are unable to use traditional input methods.
